- Improve project structure and automate release process.  See the documentation
  at https://ibm.github.io/ibmi-bob/#/contributing/getting-started for how to 
  setup development and run linter and tests and also release using `nox`.  
  Github actions are configured to be triggered when a tag of the vn.n.n-n is 
  pushed to master to publish to the yum repository.
* Mon Nov 14 2022 Edmund Reinhardt <edmund.reinhard@ca.ibm.com> - 2.4.6

* Mon Nov 14 2022 Edmund Reinhardt <edmund.reinhard@ca.ibm.com> - 2.4.5
- BINDDIR source now has the file extension BINDIRSRC to differentiate it from

  `makei compile -f <dir>:<file>` to be able to build any arbitrary list of 
  files and directories
- The iproj.json has additional attributes for iasp and sql attributes like 
  current schema, path and sql vs system naming. (These are not yet supported
  within BOB, but are present for future extensibility and other tooling that
  will support them.
- Note for CL Pseudo source, make sure that you delete the target object before 
  creating a new version to ensure the timestamps are accurate and the make 
  processing works correctly
